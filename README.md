- Total Profit; The total profit from 2014-2018 was calculated using the **SUM** function to add up all the values in the profit column.
- Number of Customers: To get the number of customers that use our store, the **COUNT** and **UNIQUE** function was used to count distinct values in the customer id column.
- Average Profit: The **AVERAGE** function was used to calculate the average profit from 2014 to 2018
- Percentage Profit Growth From 2014 to 2018: To get the percentage profit growth, the total profit from the first year of operation which was 2014 and the current year which is 2018 was calculated using the **SUMIF** function and then we subtracted the total profit for the current year 2018 from the first year of operation 2014 and then divided it by the total profit from the first year and multiply it by 100.

Amongst all of the store's categories, the **Furniture** category contributed the least to the store's profit but the **Technology** category contributed the most to the store's profit through 4 years of operation. This insight can help guide the store to stock up on more technological category equipment to ensure profitability in the coming years.
## Percentage Quantity Bought per Category

**Office supplies** were bought in large quantities compared to other categories, which contributed to the **42.77%** of profitability of the store. Since office supplies are bought in larger quantities, it is advisable for the store to sell its office supplies wholesale to increase its profitability.
## Profit Distribution per Region

The store has made most of its profit from sales in the **West**, this region is the store's most active purchasing customer. The store should aim its advertisement towards the western region of the country for it to see increased profitability.
## Average Profit per Segment

The average profit provided by the **Home office** segment was the peak at **$33.82** per sale, this signifies a higher purchasing power from the home office segment.
